A8 : 
Passes all tests.

New Passes added : 
    - expose-allocation-pointer - Changed source grammar to remove alloc

Modifications in other passes :
    - expose-frame-var - Conversion of mset! and mref takes place in this. Added appropriate changes to source grammar
      Reason : It parses the AST in the same way as required for mset and mref conversion, hence added the convert as a method and added 2 rules to enable conversion, the file needs renaming to reflect it.

    - select-instructions :
      Added rules to move mset! index to unspillable when it is a framevar , similarly addded unspillables for handling frame to mref
